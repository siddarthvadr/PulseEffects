SonicPhantom StudioMAX impulse response samples - by Vinardo_ZzZ 2000 @ xda-developers.com

First of all, what these IRS does:
- Powers up bass response
- Clears and reduces artifacts and noise
- Extends clarity of voices and dialogs
- Rebuilds audio details and fidelity
- Optimizes and corrects signal phase

Alright. What should I choose?
1. If you're watching adventurous or thrilling movies, the "Watching" profile should be the best. Even if you're watching ordinary movies or streaming online videos...
2. Want more intimidating gaming experience? The "Gaming" profile will put you to the battle field and you will hear explosions and bullets fly through realistically!
3. Songs and music doesn't get good enough? Get the highest possible clarity and powerfully deep bass and mids with the "Listening" profile.
4. If you can't listen to someone's voice clearly because of lack of clarity, you can boost the conversation and voice, or even vocals with the "Speaking" profile!
5. If you really don't what to choose or the other profiles doesn't match the current situation, using the "Anything" profile will still optimize the fidelity and clarity of your audio...

If you think:
Q: "But the audio output I hear doesn't sound too good... Can I request a better one?"
A: "Of course you can! As long as you ask me to do so via my IRS thread..."

Q: "Can I request more profiles?"
A: "Yeah you can. Just tell me the problems you're experiencing (e.g. lack of clarity)"

Q: "Is this a real line-in recorded IRS or custom?"
A: "Custom. I just thought about a name. So I call it SonicPhantom StudioMAX. LOL too dramatic... :p"

Q: "Should I donate?"
A: "Actually I don't need any donations right now. But you can if you want, via PayPal. As long as you really want to donate :)"
